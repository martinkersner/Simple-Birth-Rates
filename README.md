## WHAT IS IT?

This is a simple model of population genetics. There are two populations, the WOMEN and the MEN. Each has settable capacity, maximum difference of appearance and intelligence
between couples which allows a reproduction. The appearance and intelligence is changing over time. The changes can be also set. The women and men move around and if one man and women are sharing one patch at the time they can reproduce if they are similar enough. The similarity is settable. When the carrying capacity of the terrain is exceeded, some agents die (according to the lowest appearance score) to maintain a relatively constant population.  The model allows you to explore how general personality of population affect the ratio of reds to blues.

## HOW TO USE IT

Each pass through the GO function represents a generation in the time scale of this model.

The MAX-CAPACITY slider sets the carrying capacity of the terrain.

The MEN-CAPACITY and WOMEN-CAPACITY sliders set the initial number of men and women have after first intitialization.

The APPEARANCE-DIFF (INTELLIGENCE-DIFF) sliders set maximum allowed difference between appearance (intelligence) of man and women if they want to reproduce.

The APPEARANCE-PLUS-MINUS (INTELLIGENCE-PLUS-MINUS) denotes change of appearance (intelligence) at each tick. Appearance increases until age of 25, then decreases. Intelligence increases until age of 55, then decreases.

The # WOMEN and # MEN monitors display the number of reds and blues respectively.

The GO button runs the model.  A running plot is also displayed of the number of women (red), men (blue) and total population (in green).
